              night will also mark a new chapter for WIM as he steps into the
              spotlight as a solo artist. After an incredible journey with HYBS,
              the duo project with Alyn, WIM has decided to pursue his solo
              career, staying true to the original vision of HYBS as a temporary
              creative endeavor. Fans can expect a setlist filled with both
              familiar favorites and new tracks that showcase his evolving
              artistry. Don't miss this chance to experience WIM's powerful live

              melodies, heartfelt storytelling, and a fresh sonic journey.
              Special guest, BABYCHAIR, will perform a 30-minute set before WIM
              takes the stage. Be mesmerized by them!
